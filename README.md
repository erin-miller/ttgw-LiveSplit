# LiveSplit Support

A mod that introduces splits for LiveSplit in [Toontown: The Grindworks](https://itsevan.itch.io/toontown-the-grindworks).

This will start the timer, split on each floor, and end the timer at the end of the run.

## Setup

1. Right click LiveSplit. Click `Control > Start WebSocket Server`.
2. Add the splits you desire. For a default run, there is the Ground Floor, Floors 1-5, and the Executive Office. There is a template available in the files called `default.lss` if you wish to use that.
3. Begin a new run!
